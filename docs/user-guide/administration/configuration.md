# Configuration

## Incident Types

Dispatch allows you to define your own incident types. To create a new incident type navigate to: `Dispatch > Incident Types > New`

Once there, you can create a name for you incident type \(this will be displayed on the report form, among other places\) and give it a short description.

Additionally you can define the service you wish to use as the default incident commander for this incident, and which document you wish to use as the Incident Document.
